# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
# NOTE:
# - dependency_validator (v5.x) hiện không handle tốt trường hợp `include:` là YAML list.
# - Để các tool CLI (đặc biệt dependency_validator) chạy ổn định, ta dùng include dạng string.
# - Khi cần include thêm rule-set khác, ưu tiên merge rules trực tiếp vào file này.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml
# NOTE: riverpod_lint include đang bị analyzer báo "include_file_not_found" trên môi trường hiện tại.
# Khi ổn định toolchain, có thể bật lại:
# include: package:riverpod_lint/analysis_options.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # Disable print statements - use AppLogger instead
    avoid_print: true
    prefer_single_quotes: true
    
    # Riverpod best practices
    # (Rules cụ thể đã được cung cấp qua include: package:riverpod_lint/analysis_options.yaml)
