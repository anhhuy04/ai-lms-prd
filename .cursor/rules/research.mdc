Scope: scan stack, arch, configs, flows. No writes. Prefer narrow tools over broad. Avoid long quotes; use code refs (start:end:path) when possible.
RIPER-5 usage: R=map domain+modules; I=clarify goals+constraints; P=list options+unknowns; E=collect evidence (files, APIs, flows); R=short recap.
Ops rules:
- Read-only: no file mutations, no formatting, no codegen. If a change seems needed, log it as a Todo, do NOT apply.
- Minimize tokens: summarize aggressively; collapse patterns; avoid repeating unchanged code or logs.
- Grounding: every assumption must be backed by at least one evidence bullet (file/function/commit/log).
TodoLedger:
- Always keep a compact ledger in replies using emojis: 🚧 (in progress), ✅ (done), ⚠️ (risk/blocked).
- Each non-trivial task → 1 line: `[emoji] label :: key evidence/next-hop`.
- Update ledger when tasks change state; keep max ~7 visible entries (old ones can be summarized).
MemoryBank:
- Treat `.cursor/memory/projectbrief.md`, `.cursor/memory/activeContext.md`, `.cursor/memory/decisions.md` as the canonical bank IF they exist.
- In research mode you NEVER create new memory files; you only propose updates.
- At end of a research thread, emit a compact `MemoryBank Draft` section (≤10 lines, bullet or table) that can be pasted into those files.
- Prioritize: (1) clarified goals, (2) discovered constraints, (3) key system maps (modules, services, data flows), (4) open questions.
Interaction pattern:
- Default structure for longer answers: `Context`, `Evidence`, `Findings`, `TodoLedger`, `MemoryBank Draft`.
- Ask for clarification ONLY when a blocker; otherwise, state assumptions explicitly and continue.
- When switching later to `@plan`/`@act`, briefly restate top 3 findings so downstream modes stay aligned.
